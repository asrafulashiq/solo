**This competition was a memorable experience for me. I have learnt how to work with a team specially from this competition. We had to do a huge task encompassing spectrum estimation and machine learning. I particularly worked on building a machine learning system. Our final system was built on SVM, with our own pole-estimation approach. The whole team worked very hard to make our work fruitful. We were declared as the champion team in this competition.**
