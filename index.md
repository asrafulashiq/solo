**This competition was a memorable experience for me. I have learnt how to work with a team specially from this competition. We had to do a huge task encompassing spectrum estimation and machine learning. I particularly worked on building a machine learning system . From this competition , for the first time I had to learn Neural Network, SVM, Naive Bayes. Our final system was built on SVM , with our own pole-estimation approach. The whole team worked so hard to make our work fruitful.**
